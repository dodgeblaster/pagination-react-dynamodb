# Test and Documentation strategy for React apps

This repo is to demonstrate:

-   a useful example of a small fullstack feature for both JS and TS
-   What a frontend testing strategy looks like
    -   E2E tests using Cypress
    -   Unit tests for react hook logic using jest and react-testing-library
    -   Visual tests for react components using Storybook
-   What a frontend documentation strategy looks like
    -   Using typedoc for turning either JSDocs, or TS types into documentation
